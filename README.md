# Multi-Lines
A very simple plugin that shows all multi-lines for all multi-combat areas outside the wilderness.

This plugin was made basically copy-pasting all the work from @Nightfirecat 's Wilderness Lines plugin and maping out all the non-wilderness multi zones.

This plugin is not meant to replace that plugin, this plugin is complementary and does not provide the wilderness nor lv20 and 30 lines.

This plugin only provides non-wilderness multi lines.

Currently only Weiss and Troll stronghold has been mapped. I plan to map all areas before DMM Armageddon Release.
