# Multi-Lines
A very simple plugin that shows all multi-lines for all multi-combat areas outside the wilderness.

This plugin was made basically copy-pasting all the work from @Nightfirecat 's Wilderness Lines plugin and maping out all the non-wilderness multi zones.

This plugin is not meant to replace that plugin, this plugin is complementary and does not provide the wilderness nor lv20 and 30 lines.

This plugin only provides non-wilderness multi lines.

Currently only Varlamore and a few Kourend areas are missing. More are being mapped constantly.

Lastest version of the Multi Lines is found on the geoJSON branch, so please use that for any developments.N B

# Heads up: Since i'm not currently playing (have an active membership) i have not yet mapped any of the varlamore pt2 and pt3 areas. Beware over there.
